# Introduction
LifeCoach is a full-stack demo project created by me, developed to mimic conversations with a Life Coach. On the Frontend, it runs on NodeJS / Vite / React. It maintains the session state used in the backend and prompts conversation with the user.   

Back End implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/andretdr/LifeCoach_BackEnd)

# Development
The front-end is developed using nodeJS / Vite / React / Bootstrap / CSS.
It is deployed on Vercel.

# Full feature list
- Mantains the session history on the front-end as a design choice to allow for a REST API in the back end.
- Responsive design for use with different screen sizes.

# Known Issues
Unfortunately due to iphone's restrictions on javascript's audio autoplay and play without user prompt, the app is not feasible for mobile.

# CBB (Can be better)
Audio records automatically instead of needing to hold click or space
